##### Info

This book is a pretty rare case as it has no chapters. That's why you don't see any table of contents here. It serves to show you how your book looks like in Writory as long as you haven't published any of its chapters.

## The Big Urgent Why

While there are many good themes for publishing blog-like content, I had trouble finding good themes that would be suitable for publishing entire books. Of course, it's always possible to use a theme intended for blog posts and hack or tweak it to work with books and chapters.

To spare me—and now you, too—these hacks and tweaks, I developed this theme. This allowed me to design a theme that's easy on the eyes and makes reading books in a browser enjoyable:

* Suitable contrast
* Suitable font sizes
* Suitable line length
* Beautiful typography
* (Almost) No iconography

## The Solution

As a result, the Writory theme features [four color schemes](/books/customizing-writory/color-schemes/) with **12.5% reduced contrast** between the brightest and darkest colors, and **12.5% increased font sizes**. The colors are based on the [Mirage Illustrations](https://icons8.com/ouch/style/mirage-1).

This theme also tries to properly reflect how taxonomies are usually handled with books: Authors are associated with books, not single chapters (whereas on a blog, authors are associated with single posts). Yet it allows for chapter-by-chapter publishing by introducing the "Story Status"—a tag that indicates if the story of the book has ended or if there are more chapters to come.
