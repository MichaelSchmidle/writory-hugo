# Hi, It’s a Pleasure to Meet You

This is the documentation and showcase of [Writory](https://github.com/MichaelSchmidle/writory-hugo-theme/)—a theme for the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Its purpose is to make publishing and reading books a pleasant experience!

The Writory theme offers **color schemes** and **font sizes** that are easy on the eyes. It allows to structure your books in **chapters** (the building blocks of books) and **series** (the collections of related books).
